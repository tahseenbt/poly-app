# A Polynomial Evaluation App

A C modules based program, polyapp to implement a simple application that constructs a polynomial expression and evaluates it for certain predetermined values. The polyapp application will receive a text file as input, that contains multiple lines of data to construct a polynomial.

Each line will contain the coefficient and exponent of a term in the polynomial. For example, 12x^3 - 4x^5 is represented by:
12 3
-4 5
